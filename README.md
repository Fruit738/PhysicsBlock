# PhysicsBlock
I want to create a physics block in minecraft using library "Rayon" which adds rigid body simulation.
So I've created it like an entity block and implemented depending interface like in Rayon documentation here: https://docs.lazurite.dev/rayon/creating-a-physics-entity
But this block behaves like simple minecraft block without using physics!
If someone worked with Rayon, help pleassssssse.
